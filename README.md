The Instagram clone app was built using React Js and its best practices
- I used React styled-components, Tailwind CSS, and SCSS for the styling.
- React router was used for routing between pages of the web app.
- I also made good use of props to seamlessly pass data from parent to child component.
-I ensured some of the components were reusable to avoid bulky code.
- I used react practices like handling events with states, clean code, and good folder structure.
- I also made use of external React libraries for some of the icons used.
